# TravelJournal-Project

It's my second React.js project. This simple React.js app styled with TailwindCSS that renders a list of travel entries using reusable components. Each Entry component receives props for image, location, title, dates, and description. The main App component maps over a static data array to generate entries dynamically. The layout is responsive and uses utility classes for styling. The project demonstrates basic React patterns like prop usage, component composition, and list rendering.
